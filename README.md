# Heart Disease Dataset Analysis
This Jupyter Notebook project analyzes the Heart Disease Dataset from Kaggle, using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to analyze and visualize the data. Additionally, we built and trained some models using scikit-learn, such as Logistic Regression, KNeighbors Classifier, and Random Forest.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run this notebook, you will need to have the following libraries installed:
    • pandas
    • numpy
    • matplotlib
    • seaborn
    • scikit-learn
### Installing
You can install these libraries using pip:

```pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn```
## Dataset
The Heart Disease Dataset is obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci). This dataset contains information about patients and whether or not they have heart disease, as well as various health metrics like age, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.
## Exploratory Data Analysis
First, we performed exploratory data analysis to get an overview of the data. We checked for missing values, duplicated rows, and outliers. Then, we cleaned the data by removing unnecessary columns and filling in missing values.
Next, we used pandas, numpy, and seaborn to analyze the data and create visualizations.
# Machine Learning Models
We used scikit-learn to build and train three machine learning models:
    • Logistic Regression
    • KNeighbors Classifier
    • Random Forest
We trained the models on a portion of the dataset, and then evaluated their performance on a held-out test set. We also used cross-validation to estimate the models' performance more accurately.
# Conclusion
In this project, we used Jupyter Notebook, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn to analyze and visualize the Heart Disease Dataset,
as well as build and train machine learning models. 
Through our analysis, we gained insights into the factors that may be associated with heart disease, such as age, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.
Our machine learning models achieved high accuracy in predicting the presence of heart disease. 
This project helped us to develop our skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
